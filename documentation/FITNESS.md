# Route Fitness Function

The Route Fitness Function is a tool designed to evaluate the quality or 'fitness' of a route based on a set of criteria. The function takes as input a graph representing road infrastructure and a route, and outputs a fitness score for the route.

## Inputs

1. **Graph**: This is downloaded from OpenStreetMap data using the `route_manager` module. The graph describes the road infrastructure as nodes and edges with certain attributes.

2. **Route**: This is a list of nodes describing a route along the graph.

## Criteria

The fitness function calculates the fitness of a route based on the following criteria, each carrying different weights:

1. **Desired Distance**: The route should be within a set error margin of the desired distance. Routes outside this margin are deemed unfit.

2. **Road Type**: Different types of roads have different fitness impacts. Some roads are preferable to others.

3. **Number of Junctions**: The number of junctions along the route affects its fitness.

4. **Complexity of Junctions**: The complexity of junctions along the route also impacts its fitness.

5. **Turns**: When turning from one road into another, it's preferable not to cross other roads. For example, in the UK, it would be preferable to turn left at a 4-way junction as opposed to right.

6. **Uphill Sections**: Uphill sections negatively impact route fitness. If it is steeper than a certain angle, it is deemed unfit.

7. **Downhill Sections**: Downhill sections positively impact fitness, up to a certain limit. Exceeding that limit deems it unfit.

8. **Number of Lanes**: The number of lanes on the road impacts fitness.

9. **One-Way Routes**: One-way routes positively impact fitness.

10. **Two-Way Traffic on Narrow Roads**: Two-way traffic on narrow roads negatively impacts fitness.

11. **Downhill Roads with Traffic Lights**: Downhill roads with traffic lights negatively impact fitness.

The fitness function is additive in nature, meaning that it sums up the weighted scores for each criterion to calculate the total fitness score for a route.

## Implementation-Specific Criteria

- The fitness value is represented as a floating-point number.
- The default value for fitness is zero (0).
- A higher (more positive) value indicates better fitness.
- If a route fails to meet certain hard criteria (such as exceeding the allowable distance range or uphill steepness), it will be deemed 'unfit' and assigned a fitness value of negative infinity (`float('-inf')`).

## Fitness Calculation

Let's denote the weights for each criterion as `w1, w2, ..., w11` and the scores for each criterion as `s1, s2, ..., s11`. The fitness function `F` for a route can be calculated as follows:

$$
F = w1*s1 + w2*s2 + ... + w11*s11
$$

If any hard criteria are not met (e.g., the route exceeds the allowable distance range or uphill steepness), then `F` is set to negative infinity:

$$
F = -\infty
$$

Please note that this is a simplified representation. In your actual implementation, you would need to define how each score `si` is calculated based on the input route and graph. The weights `wi` can be adjusted based on the importance of each criterion.

Remember to normalize your scores and weights so that they contribute proportionally to the final fitness value. For example, if one score is typically in the range of 0-1 and another is in the range of 0-100, you might want to normalize them to the same scale.

Also, keep in mind that this formula assumes that higher scores are better. If for some criteria a lower value is better (e.g., fewer junctions), you might need to invert the score for that criterion. For example, if `s3` is the number of junctions, you could use `1/s3` or `max(s3) - s3` as the score in the formula.

Please note that these criteria and their weights can be adjusted based on specific requirements or constraints.
