class Fitness:
    """

        Calculate route fitness score.

        This method calculates the fitness of a route by summing up the
        weighted scores for each criterion. If any hard criteria are not
        met (e.g., exceeding allowable distance range or uphill steepness),

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : dict
            A dictionary containing the graph and route. The graph represents
